  title = {Mathematical Logic},
  publisher = {Dover Publications},
  year = {1967},
  abstract = {Undergraduate students with no prior classroom instruction in mathematical logic will benefit from this evenhanded multipart text by one of the centuries greatest authorities on the subject. Part I offers an elementary but thorough overview of mathematical logic of first order. The treatment does not stop with a single method of formulating logic; students receive instruction in a variety of techniques, first learning model theory (truth tables), then Hilbert-type proof theory, and proof theory handled through derived rules. Part II supplements the material covered in Part I and introduces some of the newer ideas and the more profound results of logical research in the twentieth century. Subsequent chapters introduce the study of formal number theory, with surveys of the famous incompleteness and undecidability results of Godel, Church, Turing, and others. The emphasis in the final chapter reverts to logic, with examinations of Godel's completeness theorem, Gentzen's theorem, Skolem's paradox and nonstandard models of arithmetic, and other theorems. Unabridged republication of the edition published by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. New York, 1967. Preface. Bibliography. Theorem and Lemma Numbers: Pages. List of Postulates. Symbols and Notations.

  abstract = {Optimal scheduling of real-time tasks on multiprocessor systems is
    known to be computationally intractable for large task sets. Any
    practical scheduling algorithm for assigning real-time tasks to a
    multiprocessor system presents a trade-off between its computational
    complexity and its performance. In this study, new schedulability
    conditions are presented for homogeneous multiprocessor systems where
    individual processors execute the rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm.
    The conditions are used to develop new strategies for assigning real-time
    tasks to processors. The performance of the new strategies is shown
    to be significantly better than suggested by the existing literature.
    Under the realistic assumption that the load of each real-time task
    is small compared to the processing speed of each processor, it is
    shown that the processors can be almost fully utilized },

ATS is a language with a highly expressive type system that supports a
restricted form of dependent types in which programs are not allowed to
appear in type expressions.  The language is separated into two components:
a proof language in which (inductive) proofs can be encoded as (total
recursive) functions that are erased before execution, and a programming
language for constructing programs to be evaluated.  This separation
enables a paradigm that combines programming with theorem proving.  In this
paper, we illustrate by example how this programming paradigm is supported
in ATS.
